# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Hollow Pong

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A variation of Pong where your paddle get larger, but at the same time parts of your paddle become hollow, allowing the ball to pass through.  The problem is, you do not see which parts of your paddle are hollow.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My game will be a variation of Poing programmed in Lua.  The software will allow the user to play a game against a simple AI/CPU that will be programmed to never miss a ball.  One feature is that the CPU will sometimes look like he is going to miss the ball (i.e. their paddle is moving slow) but at the last second, the paddle speeds up to hit the ball.  Additionally, the player's paddle will get larger as the game goes on, but also a higher percentage of the paddle will become hollow. Eventually, 100% of the player's paddle will be hollow and thus they will lose.  One feature I want to include (but do not know if time will permit) is randomly generated Tetris-like blocks appearing in the arena.  These blocks will be hollow for the CPU but solid for player, once again making it harder for the player to win (impossible, actually).  The main goal with this game is to make the player's time playing the game as miserable as possible!

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

This is solo project.

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

No matter what, I will design a game of Pong that has the hollow paddle's and a CPU that looks like it is going to miss the ball but speeds up at the last second.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be the previous two features but also the randomy generated Tetris blocks that are hollow for the CPU but not for the player.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Simply put, the best outcome for this project for me would be the previous 3 features but also adding some customization to the game; the player would be able to change their paddle color, arena color, and ball color through an options menu (for example)

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

My next steps will first be to follow the CS50 course on Pong to learn the Lua programming language and how to design games in it.  I believe that the next challenge will be to figure out how to make only a certain portion of the paddle hollow but also make that hollow portion larger as the game goes on.  Next, I will need to research some basics on random generation to figure out how to how ot randomly generate Tetris blocks.  This knowledge may come from a "how to code Tetris" tutorial because learning how to make the blocks in Lua will be the challenge.  The last part will be figuring out how to add a main menu to my game and how to add customization like arena color, ball color, and paddle color, which I hope will turn out to be easier than I currenlty believe.
