# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

For the final project, I plan on doing a game.  Specifically, I will use the PYGame module to
create my 2D game.  My dream would be to create a mashup of Mario and Terraria, but I don't know
if that will be too ambitious.  The mashup would involve the foward movement of Mario with the enviorment 
of Terraria.  By that I mean while the player character is running on the course, there will be
obstacles like trees or lava pits the player would have to mine/jump over respecitvley.  I
feel like adding "mobs" would be too ambitious but I will experiment with having a simple
mob the player character would have to kill in order to advance.  I don't have an art style lined
up at the moment but I feel like a pixel art style would work best (akin to Minecraft).

Another idea I had was to put a spin on Pong.  My twist would be that throughout the game,
random parts of the player's paddle are not solid, meaning the ball can pass through the player's
paddle even thought it looks as though the paddle is still solid.  The player would not know which parts
of their paddle are solid or not solid as it would still retain its white appearence.  I would
most likely have to make the paddle larger for this idea to work well and maybe increase the speed
of the ball.  This idea sounds good in theory but I do not know how fun it will be in practice.

At the moment, these are my two ideas.  Over the weekend I will decide between the two, but right now
I am leaning more towards the Terrarria/Mario mashup as it just seems like it will challenge me
more, but who knows.  I want a project that will challenge me but not take up every hour of my day.

## If you plan to collaborate with one or two classmates, what are their names?

Just me, myself, and I

## Do you have any questions of your own?

None at the moment
